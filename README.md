3)Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27

4)Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))


5)Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))


6)Consider the following tree:

Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance?

7)How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))
